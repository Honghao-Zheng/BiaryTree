### This binary tree implementing the IBinary tree interface stores integer value and has the following functionalities:

- obtaining the value of the root node
- add integers to the tree
- verify whether a value is contained on the tree collection
- find the child values of a specific node
- compute the sorted array list of integers in the tree
